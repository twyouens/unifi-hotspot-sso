# Single Sign on SAML authorization for UniFi controller

This is a service that uses the Art-of-wifi Unifi API and SimpleSamlPHP to provide authorization for users/ guests on a UniFi network.

Release coming in August.

In my organisation we use Keycloak as our IDP, so this will show how to set it up with Keycloak and SimpleSamlPHP.
