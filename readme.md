# Single Sign on SAML authorization for UniFi controller

This is a captive portal service that allows users to authenticate with SAML SSO. It is based of the Art-of-Wifi UniFi API and https://github.com/simplesamlphp/simplesamlphp.

Release coming in July.

In my organisation we use Keycloak as our IDP, so this will show how to set it up with Keycloak and SimpleSamlPHP. For the UniFi controller we have it on a Cloud Key gen 1.
